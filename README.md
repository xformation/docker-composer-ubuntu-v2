This is a fork from grafana monitoring platform. The synectiks monitoring platform stack primariliy have extended the following tools & utilities and composed of some of our own written components:

1. The collection stack uses prometheus / some prometheus exporters ( written by us) / Telegraph collector / some plugins for telegraph (written by us), and some scrap jobs that run in jenkin container cluster.

2. The Data storage stack primarily consist of influxdb/ OpenTSDB for realtime data store , Elasticsaearch cluster for some meta data and structured data store

3. The UI layers dashboard & alrets are mainly written as grafana plugins , primarily written by using synectiks react libarary , and we have used many cases to create dashboard based on graphql queries.
